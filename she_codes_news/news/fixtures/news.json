Since starting in 2015, Shecodes has grown from running a couple of one day workshops throughout the year in Perth to hosting events and programs that last up to 6 months. With workshops opening in Port Hedland and Brisbane and an eye on other eastern cities, Shecodes is charging towards their ambitious target.\r\n\r\n\r\nKate is smashing the outdated stereotype of there being no women in tech and Shecodes represents the inclusive, diverse nature of the Perth startup scene and a future path for many women wanting tech training to enter the Australian workforce.\r\n\r\nComing from a non-technical background, Kate began Shecodes out of curiosity and a desire to learn.\r\n\r\n“When I was looking around, I couldn’t find any [coding] communities that were friendly to women or friendly to beginners. So, we started this as beginner-friendly, female-friendly activity.”\r\n\r\nThe demand for female focused coding workshops became significantly apparent, where now, Shecodes events often sell out and even has a waiting list.\r\n\r\nOur last program sold out in about 3 or 4 hours with nearly double the amount of people who were interested. I get told all the time that ‘there’s no women in tech because women don’t want to learn to code’, and that’s totally untrue. There are hundreds of women out there that are keen to learn, they just need to be given those types of opportunities.\r\n\r\nKate Kirwin\r\nShecodes growth has been accelerated by the amazing reception and support they’ve received from some of their corporate sponsors. With BHP cold emailing Kate one day and working together closely to develop programs.\r\n\r\n“[BHP] has been with us every step of the journey now, suggesting kind of ways that we can strengthen the partnership and increase the partnership. And we’ve built a program together; the Shecodes Plus program.”\r\n\r\nThe increasing demand for individuals with coding and tech skills, and competition between government and private sectors looking to entice emerging talent, means initiatives like Shecodes are vital to the talent pool in Perth and Australia.\r\n\r\n“Our super, crazy ambitious goal is [to train] 100,000 women… Where that number comes from, if anyone’s curious, is that there’s a study saying we need 200,000 more people in tech by 2025 for Australia to remain globally competitive as a country. So, we were looking at that statistic and thinking, wouldn’t it be amazing if half of those were women?”\r\n\r\nDespite taking on the challenge to literally fill half the gap in Australia’s tech talent pool over the next few years, Kate Kirwin still finds time to put on a variety of other hats. Being a part of Spacecubed team, Kate hosts many of the Perth startup community events including Plus Eight and Startup Weekend. Not to mention her work with Women in Technology WA (WiTWA), the female founder orientated venture fund, SheEO and her semi-professional Hoola-Hooping career.\r\n\r\nKate’s energy, success and genuine desire to help others hasn’t gone unnoticed, and she was this year awarded a 40 under 40 award before even reaching her 30’s. Although it’s the people to people rewards that really drive Kate forward.\r\n\r\n“I know it sounds really corny, but I want to leave the world better than I found it and to have that kind of legacy of impact and have that purpose in the world. And I want to work with really good people, so having like-minded people around and kind of building those relationships and just seeing them grow, that’s super motivating for me.”\r\n\r\nCheck out Shecodes Australia for more information on their workshops and pay a visit to Spacecubed if you’re interested in getting involved in the startup community.\r\n\r\n~~\r\n\r\nSpacecubed is a sponsor of Startup News", "category": "news"}}, {"model": "news.newsstory", "pk": 8, "fields": {"title": "Here are some inspirations to keep you coding!", "author": 2, "pub_date": "2023-11-30T16:00:00Z", "image_url": null, "content": "https://shecodes.com.au/wins-wall/", "category": "wins"}}, {"model": "news.newsstory", "pk": 9, "fields": {"title": "test", "author": 2, "pub_date": "2023-12-01T16:00:00Z", "image_url": null, "content": "Hi Naomi", "category": "blog"}}, {"model": "news.newsstory", "pk": 10, "fields": {"title": "Test", "author": 2, "pub_date": "2023-12-01T16:00:00Z", "image_url": "https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/format:webp/1*FwfJfMOdufFQ7AU7vYzj6Q.png", "content": "testing images", "category": "blog"}}, {"model": "news.newsstory", "pk": 11, "fields": {"title": "Testing author lookup", "author": 3, "pub_date": "2023-12-02T16:00:00Z", "image_url": null, "content": "testing", "category": "blog"}}, {"model": "news.newsstory", "pk": 12, "fields": {"title": "test", "author": 3, "pub_date": "2023-12-04T16:00:00Z", "image_url": null, "content": "trst", "category": "wins"}}, {"model": "news.newsstory", "pk": 13, "fields": {"title": "New Story - edit", "author": 1, "pub_date": "2023-12-06T16:00:00Z", "image_url": null, "content": "Testing testing - edited", "category": "news"}}, {"model": "news.newsstory", "pk": 14, "fields": {"title": "Celebrating Women in Tech: She Codes Exceptional Award-Winning Month", "author": 1, "pub_date": "2023-12-09T02:00:00Z", "image_url": "https://shecodes.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/She-Codes-Awards-Banner-600x400.png", "content": "Is this our most awarded month ever?

She first found out about She Codes through a friend that does hula hooping. “I didn’t know that that was a thing, that there was a space for women to learn coding” she shares.\r\n\r\nIn high school, Tracy’s favourite subjects were physics and maths. She shared with us that she went along to a university open day and the lecturer afterwards told her “Someone with your personality would be terrible in the lab”. From that one interaction, Tracy abandoned ideas of working in a STEM field and enrolled in law/arts instead. Tracy went on to tell us that after university she “couldn’t wait to leave Perth” thinking that there would be no opportunities there, moving to Melbourne to work in investment at ANZ in financial planning. After her partner got an offer to move to Germany, she had her first experiences working in tech in startups for 4-5 years. Tracy says “80-90% of the people I worked with were developers, computer vision experts, and 80-90% of them were men. My perception of the industry was all men, I had never seen so many women working in tech”.\r\n\r\nSince moving back to Perth, Tracy joined Women in Tech WA, undertook She Codes Flash and realised she had aspirations to be a developer and be on the other side of the tech industry from the business development side she had experienced for so long.\r\n\r\nTracy fell pregnant during the Plus program, and just had her first son.

Below she shares her experience with the program.\r\n\r\nWhen asked how her tech journey began, Tara shared that while she doesn’t have any formal tech qualifications, she had always had an interest in technology and put her hand up where she could to help with new systems and data related tasks at work.\r\n\r\n“This often led to falling into an ‘accidental tech support’ role at organisations, a role which I have enjoyed. However, it was in early 2022 after going on a training course for developing online courses that kickstarted a more proactive search to learn coding.”\r\n\r\nWhen asked how she first discovered She Codes, Tara shared that she was looking for coding courses online when she found the She Codes program.\r\n\r\n“This was exciting as I couldn’t find any other face-to-face courses that were supporting women working full-time in Australia, particularly for a program as long as six months”.\r\n\r\nTara goes on to explain that at the time, She Codes programs were only offered in Perth and Brisbane, so she signed up to the mailing list to keep up to date on any further expansion of the program.\r\n\r\n“To my delight, only a couple of months later I received an email announcing that the 1-day workshops and Plus Program were coming to Sydney. I signed up for the 1-day workshop immediately and enjoyed it so much that I went on to attend the information night for the Plus program and ultimately submit an application when they opened”. She continued.\r\n\r\nWhen asked how the Plus Program has impacted her, she shared the following.\r\n\r\n“I think one of the biggest impacts so far is gaining the confidence to take the transition into a tech role seriously. Without a degree or background, I found the industry intimidating. In hindsight it seems silly, but I honestly thought that people would laugh at me if I mentioned the idea of becoming a software developer. However, everyone around me has been extremely supportive.”\r\n\r\n“Going to class each week and seeing women on a similar journey as me is very encouraging and the mentors take each person’s goals and aspirations seriously. The more time I spend in the program, the more excited I am to think of tech as a realistic career path.” She continued.\r\n\r\nDiscussing what her favourite aspects of the program were, Tara shared that the mentors have been a huge highlight for her.\r\n\r\n“Hearing directly from people currently working in the industry about their experiences and how they first got started in their careers has given me lots of insight into the industry.”\r\n\r\n“It’s also very encouraging to have so many amazing people supporting the cohort and working so hard to help us succeed.”\r\n\r\nWhen asked what success looks like and what’s next after the program, Tara expressed that these were questions she asks herself every week.\r\n\r\n“To me, success is the motivation to continue learning and building upon the skills and tools that we have gained in the program. I am still discovering the many different roles out there, but so far have enjoyed working more with the backend projects.”\r\n\r\n“Ultimately, I would like to remain working in the not-for-profit sector but move into a developer role where I can continue to learn while working on real projects. I also hope to give back to She Codes in the future by being involved in the growing alumni community in Sydney and perhaps one day even being a mentor myself.” She concluded.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about She Codes Plus, and stay involved in upcoming opportunities, make sure you sign up to our mailing list here and follow us on socials!", "category": "blog"}}, {"model": "news.newsstory", "pk": 21, "fields": {"title": "She Codes Plus Showcase: Tips for Building a Career in Tech", "author": 1, "pub_date": "2023-12-09T15:19:00Z", "image_url": "https://shecodes.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1607996929688.jpeg", "content": "At Women in Digital, we are fierce advocates for connecting, educating, and empowering women to give them the skills and support they need to thrive in the tech industry.
